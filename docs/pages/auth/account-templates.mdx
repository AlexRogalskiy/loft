Account Templates are a way to automatically create an account in a connected clusters for a new team or user and optionally create other resources that belong to such an account. 

Since cluster access is determined in Loft by who has an account in which cluster, creating an account in a cluster is equivalent of giving a user access to a cluster. Account templates are particularly useful when using single sign-on because users are being created when they log in for the first time and without any cluster accouns, a new user will not able to do anything. Account templates can solve this by automatically creating account for such users.

A cluster account template is a Custom Resource in Kubernetes and consists of 3 components:
1. **Cluster Selector**: A label selector to selects clusters to define in which clusters a new account will be created.
2. **Account Template**: An account template that specifies how the created account should look like.
3. **Templates For Additional Account Resources**: An array of owned resources (e.g. AccountQuota, ClusterRoleBinding etc.), which the account owns and an owner reference to the account is set. This has the
advantage that if the account is deleted, all of his owned resources are deleted as well and ownership of resources can be easily identified.


## Create Account Templates
You can create cluster account templates either via kubectl or the loft UI.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ui"
  values={[
    { label: 'UI', value: 'ui', },
    { label: 'kubectl', value: 'kubectl', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="ui">

Navigate to the Account Templates section under `Users` and press `Add Cluster Account Template`.

<figure class="frame">
  <img src="/docs/media/ui/auth/cat-create-01.png" alt="Create a new Cluster Account Template" />
  <figcaption>Create a new Cluster Account Template</figcaption>
</figure>

You will be presented with several options how the Cluster Account Template can be configured:

<figure class="frame">
  <img src="/docs/media/ui/auth/cat-create-02.png" alt="Create a new Cluster Account Template" />
  <figcaption>Create a new Cluster Account Template</figcaption>
</figure>

First, you can optionally specify Kubernetes **Metadata of Cluster Account Template** such as annotations or labels for this Account Template object.

Then, you can specify what the account template should do:
1. **Select Clusters**: Labels in the form of `label1=value1` that specify in which clusters an account should be created in. If empty, all clusters are selected. You will see which clusters are selected in the account templates table under the column 'Selected Clusters'
2. **Create Account in Clusters**: Account settings for the account that will be created in the cluster. This section is very similar to the `Space Creation Settings` section in the `Clusters -> Accounts` drawer.
3. **Create Account Resources in Clusters**:
    - **Account Quota**: Here you can define the hard limits for an account quota that will be created for the account. Leave empty to create no AccountQuota for the account.
    - **Cluster Role Bindings**: For each of these cluster roles, a [ClusterRoleBinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-and-clusterrolebinding) is created for the account. Use this for example if you want to grant a user full cluster access.
    - **Other Resources**: Other custom kubernetes resources that should be created in the target cluster for the account. This can be any kubernetes resource yaml. Bear in mind that:
      - No metadata section required: loft will automatically set metadata.generateName if no metadata for a resource is provided
      - You can use ${LOFT_ACCOUNT_NAME} as a placeholder for the account name. For example, in an AccountQuota you can set `spec.account: ${LOFT_ACCOUNT_NAME}`. This will be replaced when the account is actually created with the correct account name.
      - An ownerReference will be set automatically for the resource that references the account. This means that deleting the account will also delete all his resources.

After you are done configuring the ClusterAccountTemplate, press `Create` to create the resource. This will not create any accounts yet.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl">

Create file `clusteraccounttemplate.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.loft.sh/v1
kind: ClusterAccountTemplate
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-account-template
spec:
  accountTemplate:
    spec:
      space:
        clusterRole: loft-cluster-space-default
  owns:
   - apiVersion: config.kiosk.sh/v1alpha1
     kind: AccountQuota
     # No metadata needed, generateName will be set automatically
     spec:
       account: '${LOFT_ACCOUNT_NAME}'
       quota:
         hard:
           limits.cpu: '8'
           limits.memory: '16Gi'
           requests.cpu: '2'
           requests.memory: '4Gi'
    - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
      kind: ClusterRoleBinding
      # No subjects needed, kiosk automatically syncs those based on the ownerReference
      roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: ClusterRole
        name: cluster-admin
```

Create the Cluster Account Template using `kubectl`:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Run this command inside the loft management cluster
kubectl create -f clusteraccounttemplate.yaml
```

## Use Account Templates
Applying cluster account templates to an user or team can be done either via kubectl or the loft UI. For automatically applying account templates to users on single sign on, please see the next section.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ui"
  values={[
    { label: 'UI', value: 'ui', },
    { label: 'kubectl', value: 'kubectl', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="ui">

<figure class="frame">
  <img src="/docs/media/ui/auth/cat-apply.png" alt="Apply Cluster Account Templates" />
  <figcaption>Apply Cluster Account Templates</figcaption>
</figure>

In the Account Templates section you are able to select one or multiple cluster account templates to apply to a user or team when creating or editing it.

:::tip Preselect Account Templates
Some account templates might be preselected, these are the templates that have the label `loft.sh/default-template: "true"` specified.
:::

:::note How Templates are applied
The account templates will be applied in the order that they are specified, if multiple account templates target the same cluster, only **ONE** account is created for the cluster and templates are skipped for a cluster if an account for that user or team does already exist.
If an error during applying the account templates is encountered, the error message can be viewed in the Status column of the user or team.
:::

:::note Reapply Templates
If you want to reapply a template for an user or team, delete it and then re-add it to the user or team. This will **NOT** delete accounts and only works for templates that have failed to apply.
If you want to delete a template and the corresponding account resources, please delete the account of the user in the cluster instead. This will delete **ALL** spaces and resources the account owns in the cluster.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl">

```bash
# Users
# IMPORTANT: Run this command inside the loft management cluster
kubectl edit user my-user

# Teams
# IMPORTANT: Run this command inside the loft management cluster
kubectl edit team my-team
```

Then change the user or team yaml according to this:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.loft.sh/v1
kind: User
[...]
spec:
  [...]
  # The cluster account templates you want to apply
  clusterAccountTemplates:
    - name: loft-all-clusters-default
```
