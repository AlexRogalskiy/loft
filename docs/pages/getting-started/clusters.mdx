Now that your loft instance is running, you are ready to connect your first cluster and prepare it for the use by your engineers.

## Connect Cluster
In the loft UI, navigate to "Clusters" and click the "Connect Cluster" button. Connecting a cluster is the first step to making a cluster available to your engineers.

<br />
<Step>1</Step>

### Cluster Name

Enter a name for your cluster. This name must be a Kubernetes-compatible object name, i.e. only lowercase characters and dashes are allowed.

Cluster names should tell engineers what this cluster is used for and where it runs, e.g. `gke-prod`, `eks-dev-us-west-1`

<Step>2</Step>

### Cluster Connection

The management cluster (the one that your loft instance is running in) is, by default, not available as connected cluster. However, if you are using the on-premise edition, you will see a button `Connect loft cluster` which will make the management cluster available as connected cluster.

<Tabs
  groupId="edition"
  defaultValue="on-premise"
  values={[
    { label: 'Connect loft cluster (On-Premise only)', value: 'on-premise', },
    { label: 'Connect a different cluster', value: 'saas', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="on-premise">

:::info On-Premise only
Because we do **not** offer Kubernetes hosting (except for hosting your loft instance), you will **not** be able to connect the loft cluster when using the SaaS edition.
