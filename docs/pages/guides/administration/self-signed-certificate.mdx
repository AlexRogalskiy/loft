By default loft will start up without tls and expects tls to be handled by an ingress controller in front of loft. However, if you want to expose loft via a NodePort or LoadBalancer service and without an ingress controller, loft is able to serve any tls certificate.

## Create the tls certificate

The server tls certificate needs to have certain DNS names included because it will be used for Readiness/Liveness Probes, Webhook, APIService and UI and hence called by different parties.

You can start by creating a new private key:
```
openssl genrsa -out tls.key 4096
```

Then create a new `ssl.conf` with the following format (include any other domains loft should be reachable under):
```
[ req ]
default_bits       = 4096
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions    = v3_ca
req_extensions     = v3_req
x509_extensions    = usr_cert

[ req_distinguished_name ]
organizationName          = Organization Name (eg, company)
organizationName_default  = loft
commonName         = Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name)
commonName_default = loft

[ usr_cert ]
basicConstraints  = CA:FALSE
nsCertType        = client, server
keyUsage          = digitalSignature
extendedKeyUsage  = serverAuth, clientAuth

[ v3_req ]
subjectAltName   = @alt_names
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage         = digitalSignature

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = localhost
DNS.2 = loft-apiservice.loft.svc
DNS.3 = loft-apiservice.loft.svc.local
DNS.4 = loft.loft.svc
DNS.5 = loft.loft.svc.local
```

Then create the certificate signing request:
```
openssl req -new -sha256 \
    -out tls.csr \
    -key tls.key \
    -config ssl.conf
```

You will be asked some basic questions which you can skip via enter and use the default value 'loft'.
Then create the certificate via:

```
openssl x509 -req \
    -sha256 \
    -days 3650 \
    -in tls.csr \
    -signkey tls.key \
    -out tls.crt \
    -extensions v3_req \
    -extfile ssl.conf
```

## Create the kubernetes secret & upgrade loft

In order for loft to find and automatically use the self signed certificate, you need to create a kubernetes secret called 'loft-cert' in the loft namespace. You can do this via kubectl:
```
kubectl create secret generic loft-cert -n loft --type=kubernetes.io/tls --from-file=tls.crt=tls.crt --from-file=tls.key=tls.key --from-file=ca.crt=tls.crt
```

If the secret already exists, delete it via:
```
kubectl delete secret loft-cert -n loft
```

Now the only thing left to do is to tell loft to use tls instead of expecting the ingress controller to handle this. This can be done via helm:
```
helm upgrade loft loft --repo https://charts.devspace.sh/ \
  --namespace loft \
  --reuse-values \
  --set useSelfSignedCertificate=true
```

If loft was already running, make sure the loft pod restarted or otherwise it will not serve the new certificate. If it has not restarted you can force a restart by running:
```
kubectl delete po --selector=app=loft -n loft
```
