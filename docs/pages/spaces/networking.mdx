To allow your cluster users to create Kubernetes ingresses to view their applications via domains, you need to install an ingress controller into the connected cluster.

## Ingress Controller
In loft, you will find the [recommended app](../clusters/apps.mdx#app-store) `nginx-ingress` which is the default ingress controller for Kubernetes.

## SSL Certificates (TLS)
To allow your users to protect their network traffic using TLS, you can install the [recommended apps](../clusters/apps.mdx#app-store):
- `cert-manager` for automatic certificates via Let's Encrypt (requires a CertIssuer)
- `cert-issuer` to create a default CertIssuer for cert-manager (make sure to specify an email address in the `Chart Values` field when installing this app)
