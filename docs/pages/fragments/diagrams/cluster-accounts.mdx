In Loft, access to a cluster is defined by a cluster account. Every user can have one or even multiple accounts for a cluster from your pool of clusters that you connect to Loft. Every one of these clusters can run in a different availability zone or even in a different cloud platform etc. So, you can connect EKS clusters from AWS and GKE clusters from Google Cloud and then give people access depending on what they need to work with.
