You can either install and run loft yourself (on-premise) **or** you can sign up for the hybrid SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) edition of loft. In both cases, you will need to create one or even multiple Kubernetes clusters for your team and connect it to loft.

| --: | :--: | :--: |
|**loft Cluster[^1]**|is <u>**hosted by us**</u> in GKE|is <u>**hosted by you**</u> in your cloud|
|**Connected Clusters[^2]**|Kubernetes clusters in **your** cloud|Kubernetes clusters in **your** cloud|
|**Comparison to CI/CD Systems**|loft Hybrid SaaS is like using a hosted CI/CD system (e.g. GitHub Actions) to deploy to your own Kubernetes clusters|loft On-Premise is like hosting your own CI/CD system (e.g. Jenkins) to deploy to your own Kubernetes clusters|

[^1] **loft Cluster** = Management cluster that manages your connected clusters (consists of: UI, Controllers, API)  
[^2] **Connected Clusters** = Kubernetes clusters that you connect to loft (will be used to create namespaces)

:::note Example
This is roughly what happens when you run `loft create space space-123 --cluster=gke-cluster-1`:

1. The CLI will create a `Space` resource with name `space-123` similar to a `kubectl create` command.
2. The loft management cluster will receive this request and create a namespace called `space-123` inside the **connected cluster** `gke-cluster-1`.
3. The loft management cluster will return a service account token with access permissions for this namespace.
4. The CLI will configure a new kube-context using this service account token.
5. You can now use this kube-context to access the new namespace and deploy an application.

If you connect multiple clusters, the CLI will always ask you which one to use for creating a new space.
