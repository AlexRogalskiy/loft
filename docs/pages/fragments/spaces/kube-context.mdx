:::info How does it work?
To provide access to a space/namespace, Loft creates a ServiceAccount and configures RBAC in a way that this ServiceAccount can only access objects within this namespace. Then, Loft generates a kube-context using the ServiceAccount token and adds it to the `~/.kube/config` file on the user's computer.
