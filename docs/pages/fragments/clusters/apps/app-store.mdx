Because loft is connected to [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh), you can install over 1,200 Helm charts with just a few clicks.

**Recommended Apps:** After connecting a cluster, loft suggests a few popular apps from Helm Hub which you can see in the "Cluster" tab. Click on one to configure and install it. Currently the following apps are recommended:
- **nginx-ingress:** allows cluster users to make their applications available on (sub-) domains via ingresses
- **cert-manager:** allows engineers to create certificates, e.g. to enable SSL for their ingresses
- **cert-issuer:** tells cert-manager to use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for generating valid certificates

**Other Apps:** To install other apps, click on "Explore other apps" and use the searchable select to find charts.
