System apps are Helm charts which are installed into the cluster by loft during the cluster initialization process, i.e. right after connecting the cluster. These apps are managed and upgraded by loft. You cannot delete or upgrade them manually because this would impact loft's ability to manage the cluster. Currently, only kiosk is a system app.
