Loft uses the CNCF project dex for single sign-on. 

The easiest case is this one:
- `$LOFT_HOSTNAME = loft.mycompany.tld` (where Loft is running)
- `$DEX_HOSTNAME = dex.mycompany.tld` (where dex should be running)
- Loft and dex should run in the same Kubernetes cluster

Then, you can set a `CNAME` record with value `loft.mycompany.tld` in the DNS configuration for `dex.mycompany.tld`.
