In order to secure your loft instance, you'll have to install cert-manager via helm first:

```bash
helm install cert-manager cert-manager --repo https://charts.jetstack.io \
  --set installCRDs=true \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait
```

Then upgrade your loft instance with helm:

```
helm upgrade loft loft --repo https://charts.devspace.sh/ \
  --namespace loft \
  --reuse-values \
  --set certIssuer.create=true \
  --set certIssuer.email=youremail@yourdomain.com
```

After a while a certificate for your loft instance should get created and your loft instance is now using a secure certificate issued by Let's Encrypt!

You can verify if a correct certificate was issued by running:

```
kubectl get certificates -n loft
NAME       READY   SECRET     AGE
tls-loft   True    tls-loft   74s
```
